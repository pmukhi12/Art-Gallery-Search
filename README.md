## User guide
Application features a weather dashboard. User is presented with a screen to input a city name with a ```Search üîç ``` button. It shows error message if user clicks on search button without entering any city name, or with an invalid city name. For any valid city, it fetches data from [OpenWeather](api.openweathermap.org), first it fetches Latitude/Longitude data for the city and then gets detail weatherdata in second api call with latitude/longitude data for that city. City name is stored in the left pane city list alongwith latitude/longtude data, so if user clicks on a city from the list it makes only the second api call for detail weather data. For each city in the city list there is a delete button at right, so when user clicks on it, that city gets removed from the list.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
